#understand the difference between the statements and expressions

#ststement is an instruction that the python intrepreter can execute
#we have seen the assignment statements so far

#an expression is a combination of values ,variables operators and calls to functions


# remember that expression can be a part of statement
#assignment statement is y=x+3,

#here expression is x+3

#and the entire line is a statement that assigns the result to the variable y
     

#multi line statements


#conditional statements
#if statements are like for if condition is true certain thing wil execute
#if condition is false that going to check for the alternative one

#if case1
 #performing action
   elif (case 2)_
#performing action

#else:
 #pewrforming action
