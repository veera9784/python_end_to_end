List Indexing
Indexing work just like in strings.

A list index refers to the location of an element in a list.

Remember the indexing begins from 0 in Python.

The first element is assigned an index 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1 and so on and so forth.


List Slicing
We can use a : to perform slicing which grabs everything up to a designated point.

The starting index is specified on the left of the : and the ending index is specified on the right of the :.

Remember the element located at the right index is not included.



and also lists contains its own functions and methods which supports lists
