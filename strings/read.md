Introduction to Strings
Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names. It could either be a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph or an entire encyclopedia. Strings in Python are actually a sequence, which basically means Python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence. For example, Python understands the string "joker' to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter).

This idea of a sequence is an important one in Python and we will touch upon it later on in the future.


Python's built-in len() function counts all of the characters in the string, including spaces and punctuation.
String Indexing
We know strings are a sequence, which means Python can use indexes to call parts of the sequence.

A string index refers to the location of an element present in a string.

The indexing begins from 0 in Python.

The first element is assigned an index 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1 and so on and so forth.

In Python, we use brackets [] after an object to call its index.



String Slicing
We can use a : to perform slicing which grabs everything up to a designated point.

The starting index is specified on the left of the : and the ending index is specified on the right of the :.

Remember the element located at the right index is not included.
