#generally functions are reusable piece of code
#which we can use again and again

#writing the code in multple lines every time wil not easy
# so for that we will use functions

     

#so many inbuilt functions we have seeen til now
#examples are print() function and len() function

     

#functions are of two types
#1.predefined(means which allready made and which we alreadsy used)
# 2.which we can create
     

# in the python function keyword is def
