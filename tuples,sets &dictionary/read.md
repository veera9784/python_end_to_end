Tuples
In Python tuples are very similar to lists, however, unlike lists they are immutable meaning they can not be changed.

You would use tuples to present things that shouldn't be changed, such as days of the week, or dates on a calendar.

You'll have an intuition of how to use tuples based on what you've learned about lists. We can treat them very similarly with the major distinction being that tuples are immutable.

Constructing Tuples
The construction of a tuples use () with elements separated by commas.


Tuple Indexing
Indexing work just like in lists.

A tuple index refers to the location of an element in a tuple.

Remember the indexing begins from 0 in Python.

The first element is assigned an index 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1 and so on and so forth.
