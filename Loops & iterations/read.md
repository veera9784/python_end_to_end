#loops are like the block of code which executes repeatedly
#in some situations we have to write the code multiple time but
#this loops redece that kind of burdern

     

#in python we have two types of loops mainly:
#1.for loop
#2.while loop

     

#for loop

#python for loops are used to loop through the iterable object(like list,tuple,set etc)
#and perform the same action for each entry
#
#for loop is allows you to iterate through a list
#performing the same action on the list
     

#while loop
#while loop is some what similar to the if atatement
#it excutes the code inside it if condition is true
#while loop continues to execute the code repeatedly as long as condition is true
